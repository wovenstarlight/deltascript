<section class="d-section" id="intro">
	<p>A project aimed at creating a complete script of <a href="https://deltarune.com">Deltarune</a> by Toby Fox.</p>

	<p>Inspired by the <a href="https://felicitations.neocities.org/">ISAT Script Project</a>.</p>

<section class="d-section" id="index">
	<h2>Index</h2>
	<p>The script has been organized by chapters and locations. <span class="orange">(ISAT Script Project has it like that, story (subdivided by locations) and locations (subdivided by story). Unless there's some more logical way of doing it...)</span></p>
	<p class="orange">(TODO: Include a full index of some sort? e.g. if we're doing Chapters as a division then /chapter1, /chapter2, etc)</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="{{ '/chapters' | relative_url }}">Chapters</a>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="{{ '/chapters#chapter1' | relative_url }}">Chapter 1</a></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Site tips</h2>
	<p>Check the bottom right menu for extra features:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="lightyellow">Compact mode</span>: Just the dialogue, no sprites, so you can focus on what's being said.</li>
		<li><span class="lightyellow">Dim colors</span>: Use slightly darker colors across the site, if the stark white-on-black strains your eyes.</li>
		<li><span class="lightyellow">Animations</span>: Toggles animated images (replaced with static PNGs) and any text effects such as shaking text (replaced with italicized or otherwise statically-formatted text).</li>
		<li><span class="lightyellow">Dyslexia-friendly mode</span>: Uses the <a href="https://antijingoist.itch.io/opendyslexic">OpenDyslexic font</a> for easier reading.</li>
		<li><span class="lightyellow">Show all choices</span>: Expands the results of all choices for easier reading.</li>
	</ul>
