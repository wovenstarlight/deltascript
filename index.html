	<h2>Site tips</h2>
	<p>The script has been organized by chapters and locations. <span class="orange">(ISP has it like that, story (subdivided by locations) and locations (subdivided by story). Unless there's some more logical way of doing it...)</span></p>
	<p class="orange">(TODO: Include a full index of some sort? e.g. if we're doing Chapters as a division then /chapter1, /chapter2, etc)</p>
	<p>Check the bottom right menu for extra features:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="lightyellow">Compact mode</span>: Just the dialogue, no sprites, so you can focus on what's being said.</li>
		<li><span class="lightyellow">Dyslexia-friendly mode</span>: Switches to the <a href="https://antijingoist.itch.io/opendyslexic">OpenDyslexic font</a> for easier reading.</li>
		<li><span class="lightyellow">Show all choices</span>: Displays results of all choices for easier searching.</li>
	</ul>
