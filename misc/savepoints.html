	<h4>Beginning</h4>
	<p>At the start of the Weird Route, as early as freezing the tutorial Virovirokun, all save point narration disappears. You only get the save menu with no accompanying commentary.</p>

	<h4>After forcefield puzzle</h4>
	<p>Up until you first enter Queen's Mansion, if Noelle is in the party, any save point will display the following narration:</p>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-text asterisk>You and Noelle were filled with power.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<h4>Castle Town, after scaring Noelle in the hospital</h4>
	<p>This accompanies the <a href="#ch2castletown">Castle Town save point</a> after you've closed the Cyber World's Dark Fountain, and overrides the normal text associated with it, including the warning about not being able to return.</p>

	<p>Precondition: In the hospital, when Kris joins Noelle outside Rudy's room, you must scare Noelle by stepping towards her (moving right) thrice.</p>
