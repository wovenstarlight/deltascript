	<h2>Standard features</h2>
	<p>Shared across all quizzes.</p>

	<h3 id="quizstart">Start of quiz</h3>
	<p class="note">Whenever a quiz begins, the screen turns blue and displays "<span class="white fnt-8bit">QUIZ!</span>"; the screen then transitions to black and then the quiz set with two radial wipes in quick succession, where Tenna reads cue cards while Susie, Kris, and Ralsei stand at their podiums.</p>

	<hr>

	<h3 id="quizmid">During the quiz</h3>

	<p class="note">The quiz question appears in a box at the top of the TV screen in the back, with options underneath and occasionally an accompanying graphic on the right. A bar at the bottom of the TV screen acts as a timer and starts out colored white, then turns yellow at the halfway point and red at the quarter point. The party members press unseen buttons on their podiums to go through the options, icons next to the answers showing their currently-selected answers: Susie and Ralsei are represented by their respective avatars while Kris is represented by the SOUL. Susie, Ralsei, and Tenna will occasionally give commentary.</p>

	<p class="note">Susie and Ralsei will typically follow your lead and choose the same option as you. For non-Bonus Round quizzes, if you wait without picking an option, they'll each choose certain options after a set time, after which they cannot change their answers. Their behavior changes during Bonus Round quizzes, where Susie and Ralsei will follow your lead if you don't select an answer; if you do choose an option, Susie will select the same option as you, while Ralsei will select a random option.</p>

	<p class="note">Once time is up or all participants have selected answers, the timer stops and answers are graded. Each participant who answered correctly has their icon covered by a green circle, while those who answered incorrectly get their icons marked with a red cross. All correct answers turn yellow and all the answers blink in and out of view. Tenna delivers some commentary on the player's chosen answer; unless specified otherwise under the "Results" heading, for non-Bonus Round quiz questions where the player didn't select an answer before time ran out, he instead delivers commentary on either Susie or Ralsei's chosen answer at random.</p>
	
	<p class="note">After Tenna's commentary is finished, the TV screen cuts to the next question if there is one, in which case Tenna says the following, holding out his cue cards with a grin as he speaks:</p>
	<d-box theme="battletalkround">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text>Next question!</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<p class="note">He then resumes looking at his cue cards while the next question displays. Alternatively, if there is no next question, the TV screen cuts to the <a href="#quizend">results screen</a>, with Tenna invariably pointing at the viewer.</p>

	<hr>

	<h3 id="quizend">End of quiz</h3>
	<p class="note">The TV screen cuts to show "<span class="white">Results</span>" presented across the top with a white bar underneath split into thirds by blue dots. In the bottom half of the TV screen are the party's avatars.</p>

	<p class="note">The results of each quiz question appear along the white bar in Os and Xs using the party's colors. Once all results are displayed, the text "<u class="white fnt-8bit">BONUS</u>" appears under the white bar. Underneath that appears the party's results, depending on how many correct answers were given in total:</p>

	<ul class="note">
		<li>0 correct answers: the bonus is "<span class="white fnt-8bit">PAIN</span>". The text "<span class="white fnt-8bit">NOT ON MY CHANNEL!!!</span>" blinks underneath their avatars.</li>
		<li>3 or fewer correct answers, if at least 1 party member got all questions wrong: the bonus is "<span class="white fnt-8bit">PAIN</span>". The text "<span class="white fnt-8bit">YOU DID BAD</span>" blinks underneath their avatars.</li>
		<li>3 correct answers, 1 from each party member; or 4 correct answers: the bonus is "<span class="white fnt-8bit">+0</span>". The text "<span class="white fnt-8bit">BARELY FORGIVABLE</span>" blinks underneath the party's avatars.</li>
		<li>5 correct answers: the bonus is "<span class="white fnt-8bit">+25</span>". The text "<span class="white fnt-8bit">NOT BAD!!!</span>" blinks underneath the party's avatars.</li>
		<li>6 to 8 correct answers: the bonus is "<span class="white fnt-8bit">+&lt;#&gt;</span>", where &lt;#&gt; is 25 times the number of correct answers. The text "<span class="white fnt-8bit">DECENT!!!</span>" blinks underneath the party's avatars.</li>
		<li>9 correct: the bonus is "<span class="white fnt-8bit">+300</span>". The text "<span class="white fnt-8bit">PERFECT!!!</span>" blinks underneath the party's avatars.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="note">In all cases, any party members who got all questions wrong get their avatars struck by lightning, dealing damage.</p>
	<p class="note">If the bonus is above 0, that many POINTs are added to the score and confetti is fired up from the bottom left and right of the stage.</p>

	<p>Unlike other questions, Tenna's response to this question is based not on what the player chose, but on what the majority of party members chose.

	<p class="note">If and only if the player selects any answer, Susie and Ralsei immediately select random answers.</p>

	<p class="note">If the player doesn't select an answer at all, neither will Susie and Ralsei. Unlike quizzes in Rounds 1 and 2, this is not treated as selecting the answer they were hovering over when the timer ran out, but rather as an incorrect answer.</p>
