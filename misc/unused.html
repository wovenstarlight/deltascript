	<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

	<p>Where...</p>
	<p>Where am I?</p>
	<p>Hello...? Anyone...?</p>
	<p>Is... is anybody out there...?</p>
	<p>Someone!? Anyone!? Can anyone hear me!?</p>
	<p>...</p>
	<p>It's dark.</p>
	<p>It's so dark here.</p>
	<p>Someone, anyone, if you can hear me...</p>
	<p>Say something... please...</p>
</section>

<section class="d-section" id="chapter2">
	<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

	<p>No one can hear me, can they...?</p>
	<p>...</p>
	<p>I guess not.</p>
	<p>To be honest, I'm not even sure if I can hear myself.</p>
	<p>It's so quiet here...</p>
	<p>... and yet, sometimes,</p>
	<p>I swear I hear something...</p>
	<p>Something like... scratching?</p>

<section class="d-section" id="chapter3">
	<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

	<p>What is this place, anyway...?</p>
	<p>How did I get here?</p>
	<p>... as if I haven't asked that question a billion times already.</p>
	<p>I...</p>
	<p>I always did have that nightmare.</p>
	<p>Walking into the darkness,</p>
	<p>With the light shining from the doorway...</p>
	<p>Then the door slams behind me.</p>
	<p>And everything goes black.</p>
	<p>... is this that nightmare?</p>
	<p>... or was everything else a dream?</p>
</section>

<section class="d-section" id="chapter4">
	<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

	<p>I'm starting to lose track of the time.</p>
	<p>Has it been days? Hours?</p>
	<p>If someone told me it's been years, I might believe them...</p>
	<p>Before, the sun came up,</p>
	<p>And so many wonderful things happened that made time meaningful.</p>
	<p>Things like breakfast, or late night TV...</p>
	<p>In this place,</p>
	<p>I don't eat or drink anymore.</p>
	<p>I can't tell if I'm awake or dreaming.</p>
	<p>I can't even tell if I'm dead or alive.</p>
	<p>It's just nothing but pitch black silence.</p>
	<p>... except for the noise.</p>
	<p>The scratching noise I sometimes hear...</p>
	<p>This sounds crazy, but even though no one can hear me,</p>
	<p>When I hear that noise, I feel like someone's listening.</p>
	<p>Anyone, if you're there... thank you.</p>
