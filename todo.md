# To-Do list
## Files/assets
* Add all portraits... sighs...
	* Ralsei's ch4 bloodstained sprites [fond smile]
		* The bloodstains are stored separately from the actual face sprites.. gonna have to figure out which versions need bloodying... might be better to just add alt versions of those than make alt versions of Every Single Portrait
	* I think I got everyone else...?
* Gotta figure out how to rebuild the font better. The ingame version isn't precisely monospace which is throwing the whole thing off ðŸ’¢ *(If you do do this, remember to correct the textbox dimensions! They're supposed to be slightly wider than the CSS has it right now!)*
* Speaking of fonts - also need the Comic Sans font
* And the "Noelle speaking really quietly" font. Sighs.

## Page design
* Gotta add more [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) to the page layout (e.g. `title` and `hide_title` are the front matter keys set at the top of the [home page](./index.html))
	* Credits section? Something like. `credits: <p>Compiled by So-and-so & such-and-such.</p>`
	* Page description. Need it for the page data anyway. Just like, `All text from Rudy Holiday's hospital room`, or `All text from Castle Town's central plaza`, you get the idea.
	* ISAT Script Project ([example page](https://felicitations.neocities.org/acts/act3-4/odilequest)) has a "Sources" field near the top where they list Maps and Events and whatnot that the text was sourced from. Maybe something similar listing the .gml script files? It'll be a headache to read though, LMAO. All named stuff like `gml_Object_obj_writer_Draw_0.gml` and whatnot.

## Specific pages
* Home page could use cleanup/more information. Some sections that might be nice to have:
	* Progress updates (what's finished/new arrivals, what's currently being focused on)
	* Priority list (what will be worked on after the current tasks are complete, what needs attention, what's been requested...)
