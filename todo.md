# To-Do list
* Add all portraits... sighs...
	* Asgore
	* Ralsei's ch4 bloodstained sprites [fond smile]
		* The bloodstains are stored separately from the actual face sprites.. gonna have to figure out which versions need bloodying... might be better to just add alt versions of those than make alt versions of Every Single Portrait
	* I think I got everyone else...?
* Clean up home page once we have an idea of how to present the damn thing lmao
* Add credits page? Or add a credits section to each page.

# Other notes
* Home page could use cleanup/more information. Some sections that might be nice to have:
	* Progress updates (what's finished/new arrivals, what's currently being focused on)
	* Priority list (what will be worked on after the current tasks are complete, what needs attention, what's been requested...)
