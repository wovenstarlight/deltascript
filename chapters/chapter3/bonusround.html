	<h2>Introduction to the Bonus Round</h2>

	<p class="note">The "technical difficulties" screen cuts briefly to black, then cuts to the TV Time set, where the party stands behind their podiums and Tenna stands to the side. Susie and Ralsei look shocked, while Tenna is pointing upwards and smiling like usual. The <a href="{% include wikilink page='And Now For Today\'s Sponsors...!' %}">TV Time theme</a> begins playing.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>WELCOME BACK to another ELECTRIFYING episode of TV TIME!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">The party members all turn to Tenna; Ralsei is wide-eyed while Susie looks unhappy.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="L"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>W-wait a second...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">The screen in the back blips as it displays a TV-themed cityscape. Tenna presses his hands together by his face, cooing. As Tenna speaks, Ralsei loses his surprise and looks uneasy.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>Today's board will take place in beautiful TV CITY...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Susie grits her teeth, head lowering and casting a shadow over her eyes, as Tenna continues talking conspiratorially to the audience.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk><funny-text name="city_feet"></funny-text></d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">The audience laughs. Tenna points upwards with a too-wide, strained smile and continues talking as Susie's fists begin to tremble at her side.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>Collect two Q's from each corner of the CITY, and...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Susie stomps and looks furious, cutting off both Tenna and the music. Tenna stops rocking from side to side as she talks.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="H"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>ENOUGH ALREADY!</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="4"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>The game's over. Give back Toriel and let us go home. Now.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">A pause.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>Game... over?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">A pause. Susie and Ralsei both duck their heads.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="4"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Mr. Tenna, I'm not certain what your plan is, but...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Ralsei lifts his head. A pause.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="I"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>We'd like to go seal the Dark Fountain now.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">He ducks his head again.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="Q"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>I think... the show's gotten a little old.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">A long pause. Susie and Ralsei lift their heads when Tenna speaks.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>... Old.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Ralsei ducks his head.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="L"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Umm, sorry, Tenna, I...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">The theme music starts back up as Tenna spreads his hands, grinning and once again rocking on his feet. Ralsei lifts his head.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>No, haha! Ralsei, RALSEI! Buddy-BOY! It's fine! I GET IT! Look, I get it!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Tenna presses his hands together by his face.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>CLASSIC TV... sometimes just takes a little TIME to APPRECIATE!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">He smiles and points upwards.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>So how about this?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">He spreads his hands.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>We'll all do ONE MORE LITTLE GAME...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Tenna straightens up, resting a hand on his tie.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>One last ENCORE!</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>And this time, we'll play</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">The music cuts off and Susie and Ralsei look startled as Tenna snarls ferociously. His next line plays slower than usual.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>Until you LIKE IT.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Gachapon capsules appear and close around each of the party members, shocking them, and the set is cast in red lighting. The TV-themed cityscape on the back screen is replaced by a cityscape on fire.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="I"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>H-hey, what the heck are you...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">The music resumes, pitched up and strained, as fire rises where the audience normally stands and the red lighting begins pulsing as Tenna dances.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk><funny-text name="game_over"></funny-text></d-text>

	<d-box theme="dark">

	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">

		<d-text asterisk>It's time for ME to TAKE CONTROL!!!</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>MIKE, crank it all up to MAX!!!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Tenna continues dancing as Susie and Ralsei begin struggling to get out of their capsules, Susie pounding against the plastic wall while Ralsei pushes ineffectually at it. After a moment's pause, Tenna points at the viewer.</p>

<section class="d-section" id="start">
	<h2>The Bonus Round starts</h2>

	<p class="note">Tenna points upwards as the screen in the background cuts to black and his TV Time avatar appears on it.</p>

	<d-box theme="battletalkround">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text>Now it's<span class="break"></span> my turn<span class="break"></span> to play!!!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">He throws his hands in the air. On the screen in the back, a burning landscape flickers into view around his avatar. As his avatar begins walking, the pounding of Susie's fists against her capsule goes silent, replaced by <a href="{% include wikilink page='Doom Board' %}">ominous music</a>.</p>

	<d-box theme="battletalkround">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text>Hey, isn't<span class="break"></span> this fun!?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Tenna, wearing a black and white suit and hat, dances with a cane.</p>

	<d-box theme="battletalkround">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text>I'm not broken!<span class="break"></span> I don't have<span class="break"></span> burn-in!<span class="break"></span> I'm... fun!!!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Once again wearing his normal outfit, he throws his hands in the air.</p>

	<d-box theme="battletalkround">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text>C'mon,<span class="break"></span> say it!!!<span class="break"></span> I'm!!!<span class="break"></span> Fun!!!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">A long pause. Tenna fixes his tie with a tight, aggrieved smile.</p>

	<d-box theme="battletalkround">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text>... Fine.<span class="break"></span> You don't<span class="break"></span> wanna say it?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">A quiz comes into view on the screen in the back, walking away from Tenna's avatar.</p>

	<d-box theme="battletalkround">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text>Maybe a quiz<span class="break"></span> will help<span class="break"></span> you answer!!!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Tenna's avatar picks up speed, and the quiz similarly begins running away from him, but can't outspeed him. Tenna's avatar catches up and a "<span class="white fnt-8bit">QUIZ!</span>" begins.</p>
</section>

<section class="d-section" id="quiz1">
	<h2>Quiz #1</h2>

	<p class="note">Though most of the quiz set remains the same, the screen in the back has a red background instead of blue, and the party members are still trapped inside their capsules and struggling. Onscreen, some of the letters periodically twitch out of place. Tenna stands to the side, holding cue cards. The usual quiz music has also been replaced by a <a href="{% include wikilink page='Metaphysical Challenge' %}">more ominous version</a>.</p>

	<d-box theme="8bit" class="doom quiz">
		<d-text>AREN'T YOU HAVING SO MUCH FUN?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">The four answers all read "<span class="white fnt-8bit">OF COURSE!</span>", and are all correct.</p>

	<hr class="hr2">

	<h3>Choosing an answer</h3>

	<p class="note">Susie and Ralsei randomly choose answers as well. All answers are marked correct, and Tenna squats with his hands spread, grinning.</p>

	<d-box theme="battletalkround">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text>THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<hr class="hr3">

	<h3>Not choosing an answer</h3>

	<p class="note">Susie and Ralsei don't choose anything either. When the time runs out, all cursors are marked wrong, and Tenna straightens his tie in irritation.</p>

	<d-box theme="battletalkround">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text>OUT OF TIME!!! WRONG!!!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">He points upwards with a painfully wide grin as all the party members are hit by lightning, taking damage, and drop down in pain.</p>

	<hr class="hr2">

	<p class="note">The quiz ends, cutting with a radial wipe to black and then to the TV Time set.</p>
</section>

<section class="d-section" id="postquiz1">
	<h2>After quiz #1, before battle #1</h2>

	<p class="note">Tenna points upwards with a smile as his avatar continues walking across the board. Susie and Ralsei have stopped struggling inside their capsules, now looking despondent.</p>

	<hr class="hr2">

	<h3>If the party needs healing</h3>
	<p>(Unlikely to occur, as failing a single quiz shouldn't deal enough damage to reduce anyone to 50% HP or below. Still, included for completion's sake.)</p>

	<p class="note">The first <a href="#healingspot-standard1">healing spot</a> interaction plays out.</p>

	<p class="note">Tenna throws his hands in the air, pleased.</p>

		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text>Just look at<span class="break"></span> that Fun-o-meter!!!<span class="break"></span> Haha!!!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Tenna spins to the side and spreads his hands, wearing an open-mouthed smiled as the Fun-O-Meter slides out from the right. It's a dull gray, with the meter completely empty. Silence for several seconds. Tenna spins back into place as the meter slides offscreen, pointing upwards again with an exaggeratedly wide smile.</p>

	<p class="note">On the screen in the back, a Shadowguy avatar has appeared to signal an encounter. Unlike usual, the Shadowguy seems to be grimacing in distress and is walking away from Tenna's avatar like the quiz before it.</p>

	<d-box theme="battletalkround">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text>I wonder<span class="break"></span> what's next?!<span class="break"></span> Looks like<span class="break"></span> a battle!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Tenna's avatar picks up speed and runs into the Shadowguy, <a href="{{ '/encounters/tennabonusround#start' | relative_url }}">starting a battle against Tenna alone</a>.</p>
</section>

<section class="d-section" id="postfight1">
	<h2>After battle #1, before minigame #1</h2>

	<p class="note">The screen, having cut to black, radial wipes back to show the TV Time set again.</p>

	<h3>If the party needs healing</h3>

	<p class="note">The appropriate <a href="#healingspot-standard">healing spot</a> interaction plays out, depending on how many times the party has needed healing so far.</p>

	<p class="note">Tenna's face-screen cuts to black as he clutches his head, thrashing about in panic.</p>

	<d-box theme="battletalkround">

	<d-box theme="battletalkround">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text>... Kris?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Tenna spreads his hands, grinning open-mouthed, as a door appears in his avatar's path; it walks up to the door and pauses.</p>

	<d-box theme="battletalkround">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text>HEY! LOOK!<span class="break"></span> Behind this door<span class="break"></span> lies another<span class="break"></span> PHYSICAL CHALLENGE!!!</d-text>

</section>

<section class="d-section" id="cookingshow">
	<h2>Minigame #1: Cooking Show</h2>

	<p class="note">The screen radial wipes to black, then to the Cooking Show set. Kris stands on the counter in their server outfit under dimmed lighting. Susie and Ralsei are at their stations in the back, both still in their capsules and original outfits; while Susie remains frozen and despondent, Ralsei is struggling again. After a moment, Tenna slides in from screen right next to Kris, leaning towards them with his hands pressed together by his face.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>Ahhh... Kris, remember when your brother was here?</d-text>

		<d-text asterisk>You used to spend so, so, much time with him.</d-text>

	<p class="note">Tenna shifts, putting his face close to Kris. When he speaks, his whole body stretches wider.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>With me.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Tenna's body returns to normal as he stands in front of Kris, spreading his hands.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>Watching cartoons. Playing games.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Tenna begins rocking back and forth, laughing and flapping a hand.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>Smiling. Laughing. Crying.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">He freezes mid-laugh. Then he begins trembling.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>Why?</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>Why don't you two do that anymore...?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">A slight pause. Tenna bolts upright and back, reeling in shock.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk> What!? He went to COLLEGE?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Tenna straightens his tie, looking aggrieved and trembling.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>Well... why'd he have to go do THAT!?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">He points upwards, rocking back and forth as usual; his next line is spoken haltingly.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>You. Can learn. ANYTHING! On TV!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>Ahahahah!!!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Tenna bolts offscreen. A long pause. Then he returns, adjusting his tie.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>Yes. The instructions. Right. The INSTRUCTIONS!!!!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Two pipes appear on either side of the screen in front of the counter, arrows indicating them. Tenna points slowly between the pipes.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Tenna</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>They're coming out of the pipes.</d-text>

	</d-box>

When the countdown ends, the minigame begins, fire falling from the top of the screen that Kris must dodge.
