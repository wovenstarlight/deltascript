	<h2>Coming across the Knight</h2>

	<p class="note">Upon reaching the top of the stairs, the party stops as Susie notices something. She points ahead, hand shaking.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="e"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>You...!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">The camera pans up to the center of the room to show the Roaring Knight floating in the air, watching the Dark Fountain in the distance. It turns its head slightly, but doesn't react otherwise.</p>
	
	<p class="note">From offscreen, Susie aims three Rude Busters at it; the Knight switches between its ball and humanoid forms to dodge them, turning towards the party after the first dodge. Once Susie stops attacking, the Knight floats to the empty column at the center of the room and retakes its humanoid form, sword drawn and facing the party. The opening in its face rotates to resemble an eye looking forward.</p>

	<p class="note">The party runs up towards it, stopping at the edge of the room's circular walkway. Susie points shakily at it again.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="m"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Nowhere to run this time, dumbass!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Susie withhdraws her hand, but is still tense.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="n"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>I dunno where you've put Toriel, but... it's over!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">She points at the Knight again, hand shaking.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="I"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>The Fountain's just past you, isn't it?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">The Knight's "eye" turns to look behind itself. Susie's hand grows steady.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="V"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>That means... we don't even have to beat you.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Susie lowers her hand and stands tall, facing the Knight.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="X"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>All we have to do is get PAST you... and it's over.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">The Knight looks at her as she takes a step forward.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="V"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>... You...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">She points at it, hand shaking.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="m"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>You can't beat us in the Light World, can you?!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">She withdraws her hand, still tense.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="o"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>That's... why you keep running, isn't it?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">A pause. The Knight begins to laugh, echoes of the grinning mouth-shaped opening in its face floating around itself. Susie points at it shakily.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="n"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Hey... hey, what's so funny?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Her hand goes still.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="n"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Kris, why... are they laughing...?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">She withdraws her hand, still tense.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="m"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>You're laughing 'cause you know I'm right, don't you!?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">The Knight abruptly stops laughing and the <a href="{% include wikilink page='Heavy Footsteps' %}">ongoing ominous music</a> stops as Susie points steadily at it. Her next line plays slowly and unskippably.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="o"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>You lose that Fountain, it's over!!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">The opening in the Knight's face turns back into the usual slit as it slowly lifts its sword. Ralsei startles in realization.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="k"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Don't...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">As the Titan's sword gleams, Ralsei darts a step forward and plants his feet, hands fisted.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="g"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>DON'T MAKE ANOTHER FOUNTAIN!!!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">But the unheeding Knight flies higher into the air, lifting its hand to summon more copies of its sword. A total of five swords hanging over its head, it sweeps its hand down and sends them plunging into the ground, making it flash white as Susie and Ralsei draw back in shock.</p>

	<p class="note">An intense cyan light begins to bloom from the empty space at the center of the walkway, and within seconds a massive column of light appears within it, the camera panning up along its length as it turns into a fully-formed Dark Fountain. Moments later, the entire Fountain is petrified into stone. The stone begins to crack and chunks fall away, revealing the white outlines of eyes in the pitch darkness beyond that look down towards the party.</p>

	<p class="note">A massive jet-black fist punches its way out of the stone column, then opens to reveal eyes along the creases of the hand and knuckles. These eyes look around; then, spotting the party below, the hand curls in on itself before releasing a massive beam of light from the eye at the center of the palm.</p>

	<p class="note">Down below, Susie and Ralsei are alerted and throw themselves to the side along with Kris to dodge the beam. They get back to their feet one by one - Susie immediately, Kris a brief moment later, and Ralsei last. <a href="{% include wikilink page='Crumbling Tower' %}">Dramatic, ominous music</a> begins playing as Susie points up at the new threat.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="e"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Wh... what is that thing!?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Ralsei takes a step back.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="Z"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>It's... It's a Titan!!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Hand still raised, Susie looks over at Ralsei.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="h"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>The hell is a...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Susie lowers her hand as she and Ralsei notice something. The Titan shoots another beam attack at them, which they dodge once more. Ralsei gets up almost immediately, followed by Susie and Kris. Ralsei turns to the others.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="o"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>There's... there's no time to explain!!</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="o"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Everyone, climb on! It won't attack itself!!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Susie and Ralsei run towards the pillar of stone and jump on one by one, climbing up out of sight. Kris follows suit. The screen fades to black as they ascend.</p>
</section>

<section class="d-section" id="postclimb">
	<h2>After the first climb</h2>

	<p class="note">After climbing the Titan's pillar, more and more of the stone giving way as the Titan emerges, the screen fades to white with Kris the only thing still visible as they fall through the air. They land on something unseen; the white turns to black before the scene slowly fades in to show Kris kneeling beside Susie and Ralsei on a Sanctuary walkway, the pillar still visible behind them. The scene is dim, with a circle of light around the party.</p>

	<p class="note">Kris stands.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="V"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>... huff... puff...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Susie stands.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="l"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Looks like we're safe...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Ralsei stands. None of them are smiling. Susie and Kris turn to Ralsei when he speaks.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="e"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>... for the time being.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Ralsei ducks his head.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="8"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>If we stay here...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">He turns away from the other two.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="b"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>... it's only a matter of time until it finds us.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Susie lowers her head, and Ralsei turns to the side, facing the player.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="e"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Ralsei, what... the hell is that thing?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">A pause. Susie lifts her head to look at Ralsei, who looks downcast.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="T"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>When the Fountain's power becomes too strong...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">He lifts his head.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="T"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>When the flow of darkness roars wild...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Ralsei turns away from the others, head lifted.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="Z"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>It makes... that.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">He ducks his head, gaze lowered.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="f"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>A Titan.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">He lifts his gaze briefly…</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="f"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>It's the fear-of-dark.</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="f"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>It's the bump-in-the-night.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">…then lowers it again.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="f"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>It's the shadow of the backside of your mind.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">He lifts his head.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="f"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>It has no consciousness.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Susie's eyes widen as Ralsei bows his head again.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="Z"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>It only exists to destroy.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">A pause. Ralsei turns to the side again, facing the player, as Susie looks down.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="h"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Well... uh...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">She lifts her head to look at him.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="h"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>How the hell are we supposed to... beat it?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">He ducks his head.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="e"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>I...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">His gaze lowers.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="f"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>... I don't think we can... It's hatching so fast.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">A pause. Ralsei's gaze lifts, though his head stays bowed.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="f"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">He turns towards the others.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="T"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Unless...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Ralsei lifts his head as Susie also turns to Kris.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="p"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Kris, you can seal Fountains, can't you?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Ralsei turns to the side, facing the player.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="q"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Maybe... if the Titan... is anything like a Fountain...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">He turns to Kris.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="R"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>You could...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Suddenly, the Titan's hand emerges from below to tear down the end of the walkway the party is standing on. They all stumble back, turning towards the end of the walkway, Susie and Ralsei wide-eyed.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="C"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>It... it's found us!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">The party runs down the walkway (or floats, in Ralsei's case), the Titan's hand destroying the path behind them. They make it up a set of stairs to a higher walkway before pausing, Ralsei facing the others as they turn to the side facing the player.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="p"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Let's find a place to climb back on, fast...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Control is briefly returned to the player, who can proceed further along the walkway.</p>

	<hr>

	<h3 id="postspawn">After defeating the Spawn</h3>

	<p class="note">The party returns to the walkway, Kris at the center flanked by Ralsei and Susie, all facing each other. The area is no longer as pitch-black as when the Spawn appeared, though it remains dim outside the party's immediate surroundings.</p>

	<h2>Facing the Titan</h2>

	<p class="note">Upon reaching the end of the walkway, the party fans out along its edge as clouds of darkness rise from below.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="l"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>End... of the line, huh.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Ralsei bows his head.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="Q"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>It... seems so.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Susie's gaze lowers.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="l"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Guess we just... wait for the Titan to show up, huh.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Ralsei's gaze lowers as well; he looks upset.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="f"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>... no.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">The howling of the wind fades as the clouds to the right of the screen fade out into pure dark. Then, accompanied by <a href="{% include wikilink page='Gallery' %}">droning music</a>, a form appears through the darkness, indicated only by faint light along its rims. The silhouetted shape is reminiscent of a massive human head.</p>

	<p class="note">Susie and Ralsei both look at the Titan's silhouetted form. Susie's eyes are wide, while Ralsei's head is still ducked slightly.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Ralsei" emotion="e"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>It's already... been here the whole time.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Ralsei lifts his head and Susie's eyes narrow, back in her usual expression, though both are unsmiling. A pause. Susie points jerkily at the Titan, grinning.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="l"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>H... Hey dumbass!</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="V"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Don't know if you got the memo... but...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Susie lowers her hand, facing the Titan head-on.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="X"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>We're heroes.</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="l"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>And there's a whole lot of stuff written in our lives</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Susie's gaze lowers.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="k"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>... we haven't gotten to see yet.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">She lifts her head, no longer smiling.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="l"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>So get out of our way.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Susie's gaze lowers.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="V"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Or... as soon as my hands stop shaking...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Susie points at the Titan, grinning.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="l"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>My axe is gonna chop you in half, got it!?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Susie lowers her hand and faces the Titan as its form brightens, revealing its many wings wrapped around itself. The wings unfurl to reveal its dark, horned form, a star-shaped shield in front of where its face should be.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Susie" emotion="l"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Kris! Ralsei! Let's go!!</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note"><a href="{{ '/encounters/titan' | relative_url }}">The fight begins,</a> with the party joined by Gerson in their attempt to <a href="{{ '/chapters/chapter4/lastprophecy' | relative_url }}">defeat the Titan</a>.</p>
