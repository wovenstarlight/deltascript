	<h2>Going to sleep</h2>

	<p class="note">The dark screen cuts to Kris's room at night, with Kris themself tucked under their bedcovers. After a moment or two, they begin to jerk and toss in bed, jitters increasing until they throw themself out of bed to land facedown on the ground.</p>

	<p class="note">Slowly, Kris gets to their feet and makes their way to the center of the room, turning to face their side of the room. They raise a slow, deliberate hand, spreading their fingers... and plunge it into their chest in a painful-looking process, tearing their SOUL out. Kris approaches the cage sitting in the corner of the room and hurls the SOUL into it, the force of the throw sending the cage rocking and making its door fly shut.</p>

	<p class="note">Kris goes back to the center of the room, facing away from the camera. They retrieve something from their left pocket and raise it, dramatically revealing it to be a knife. Turning to look over their shoulder at the camera, they smile, eye flashing red.</p>

	<p class="note">The screen cuts to black, and the chapter ends.</p>
