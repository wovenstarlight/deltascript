			<p>Have you ever seen such a pose? This "victory pose" is also rumored to be Tenna's "default pose," only made when comfortable healthy. That it's his "default" indicates he's "always winning", the "little king" of his story, a true "sparker."</p>
			<p>This pose's glory has some believing it may soon become a phenomenon. Like everything Tenna, it's sure it will stay relevant and amusing for ages to come!</p>
