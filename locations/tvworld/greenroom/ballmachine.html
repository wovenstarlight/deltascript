	<h4>Upon inserting POINTs</h4>
	<h5>Standard</h5>

The machine shakes briefly before a capsule is released from the bottom slot, floating up in front of the machine and coming apart to reveal the prize inside. <a href="#prizes">See below</a> for the narration/dialogue accompanying certain prizes.</p>

	<p class="note">After the prize-specific dialogue/narration plays, if your score is still at 100 POINTs or higher, then the following narration is shown:</p>

		<d-text asterisk>PLAY AGAIN?</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<p class="note">â€¦after which you are returned to the <a href="#playchoice">menu where you can choose to insert more POINTs</a>.</p>

	<p class="note">If your score is instead below 100 POINTs after the prize-specific dialogue/narration, dialogue ends.</p>

	<h5>If 1225 POINTs were inserted</h5>
	<p class="note"><a href="#1225">See below.</a></p>

<section class="d-section" id="1225">
	<h2>Inserting 1225 POINTs</h2>

	<p class="note">Immediately upon pressing [CONFIRM], the oscillating stars in the background disappear, leaving behind a background of solid dark blue; the music also cuts out, and the arrows beside the "POINTs TO SPEND" value disappear. The screen is frozen for a few seconds.</p>

	<p class="note">Abruptly, the screen cuts back to the Ball Machine room, now tinted a dim blue. The user guide sign, Susie, and Ralsei are all missing. Kris is the only one in the room, still standing in front of the POINTs machine. Nothing in the room can be interacted with, and Kris cannot leave the room.</p>

	<p class="note">On the front of the Ball Machine, the red slot from which capsules emerge is missing. Instead, there is a black opening roughly the size of a door. Kris can walk up to this opening, at which point the screen will slowly fade to black.</p>

	<p class="note">The screen will then fade back in on a mysterious room with a dark blue checkered background over which a maze of red-carpeted walkways sprawl as <a href="{% include wikilink page='findher' %}">a guitar version of Lost Girl</a> plays. The room has no collision, allowing Kris to move off the walkways over thin air.</p>

	<p class="note">The room loops in all directions, and there is almost nothing within it. Towards the bottom right, however, is a small blue ball machine that appears completely empty. This is the only object in this entire room with collisions enabled, so that Kris cannot walk through it. Upon interacting with it from any direction, the following narration plays:</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-text asterisk>You used the machine.</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-text asterisk>... The capsule came out.</d-text>

	<d-box theme="dark">

	<d-box theme="dark">

	<d-box theme="dark">

	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">

	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-text asterisk>And you couldn't find it anymore.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">The music fades out quickly as soon as the previous line is completely printed, and the following narration plays slowly, unskippably, and soundlessly:</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-text asterisk>You couldn't find<br><br>your hand.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">The screen slowly fades to black. Then it fades back in on Kris standing alone at the center of the Ball Machine room, now with the ball machine and POINTs machine absent, leaving it permanently and completely empty. There is no music playing. Kris can leave the room, at which point Susie and Ralsei are back in the party and the music resumes as normal, even upon reentering the Ball Machine room.</p>

	<p class="note">Upon reentering the room after this point, if the <a href="{{ '/chapters/chapter3/cityboardsword' | relative_url }}">Sword Route</a> has been completed and the <a href="{{ '/chapters/chapter3/egg#nowhere-bibliox-mantle' | relative_url }}">Bibliox in "nowhere"</a> has been spoken to, there is a <a href="#tripticket">glimmer on the ground</a> where the Ball Machine used to be.</p>
