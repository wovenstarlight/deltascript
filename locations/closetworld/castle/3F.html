	<p>Available to interact with only under specific conditions - if Kris is separated from the party, or if Tenna didn't survive Chapter 3. Otherwise, the door can be walked through without commentary.</p>

	<h3 id="tennadoor-alone">When Kris is alone</h3>

	<h3 id="tennadoor-dead">If Tenna didn't survive Chapter 3</h3>
	<p>If Tenna was defeated violently, or if the Shadowguys and Pippins weren't recruited and thus didn't help patch him up at the end of the chapter. The door is boarded up. (Gets overridden by the above dialogue when applicable.)</p>
