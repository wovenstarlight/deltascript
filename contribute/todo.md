## Page design
Nothing right now!

## Specific pages
* Home page could use cleanup/more information. Some sections that might be nice to have:
	* Progress updates (what's finished/new arrivals, what's currently being focused on)
	* Priority list (what will be worked on after the current tasks are complete, what needs attention, what's been requested…)
* ch3 0.0.094/ch4 0.0.094 has typo fixes:
	* `obj_dw_church_waterfallroom` "if only you had something **to** help you climb"
* ch4 0.0.098:
	* `gml_Object_obj_dw_church_darkmaze_Step_2` If Guei's OldMan is used on the same turn as both Gueis are spared, then Gerson's cane falls out of the encounter and slides over into his study, and interacting with it fast enough gets you a `Thar she blows` line

			* by "interactions in the streets" i mean things like. sans outside the grocery store. rain kid playing in the puddles. the milk sicko being like "Damn your family is messy as hell" in chapter 4
			* could put them under the building they're closest to…? But what if they're like. Not directly related to the building. I'm thinking about chapter 2 undyne "handling" the traffic jam next to the library. That wasn't involved with any nearby building

	* `/chapter5`
	* `/chapter6`
	* `/chapter7`
* `/encounters` - Check descriptions, ACT descriptions, etc. This is probably gonna have a ton of subpages, I'd guess one for every potential enemy. At the very least, the big story-critical encounters (e.g. all boss fights) would need their own subpages which the `/chapters` pages could then link to.
	* OK SO. The rule I've settled on is that if dialogue has the fancy silver border then it doesn't count as part of the encounter, it's instead a pre-/post-fight cutscene which will get its own page under `/chapters`. So only include the dialogue that's actually using the encounter UI on these pages.
		* Some of the chapter 1 pages don't follow this rule yet but that's going to be fixed don't worry
	* Include disambiguation pages for the following. Maybe we give them more descriptive names…? Double-check the URLs before creating the disambigs
