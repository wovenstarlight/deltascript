# To-Do list
## Files/assets
* Add all portraits... sighs...
	* Ralsei's ch4 bloodstained sprites [fond smile]
		* The bloodstains are stored separately from the actual face sprites.. gonna have to figure out which versions need bloodying... might be better to just add alt versions of those than make alt versions of Every Single Portrait
	* I think I got everyone else...?
* Gotta figure out how to rebuild the font better. The ingame version isn't precisely monospace which is throwing the whole thing off ðŸ’¢ *(If you do do this, remember to correct the textbox dimensions! They're supposed to be slightly wider than the CSS has it right now!)*
* Speaking of fonts - also need the Comic Sans font
* And the "Noelle speaking really quietly" font. Sighs.

## Page design
Nothing right now!

## Specific pages
* Home page could use cleanup/more information. Some sections that might be nice to have:
	* Progress updates (what's finished/new arrivals, what's currently being focused on)
	* Priority list (what will be worked on after the current tasks are complete, what needs attention, what's been requested...)
