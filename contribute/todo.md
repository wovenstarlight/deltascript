# To-Do list
## Files/assets
Nothing right now!

## Page design
* Add the OpenDyslexia toggle back in. Requires checking all the site features with it enabled and confirming that everything's sized properly.

## Specific pages
* Home page could use cleanup/more information. Some sections that might be nice to have:
	* Progress updates (what's finished/new arrivals, what's currently being focused on)
	* Priority list (what will be worked on after the current tasks are complete, what needs attention, what's been requested...)

### Page list
Brainstorming what pages we'd want. This is a changeable list! Feel free to add and edit!

* Locations `/locations`
	* Light World i.e. Hometown `/lightworld`
		* `/dreemurrresidence` - Kris/Toriel's home
		* `/holidayresidence` - Noelle's home
		* School
			* exterior...? IIRC in ch4 end Susie will stop at the doors with some dialogue...
			* `/torielclass` - Toriel's classroom
			* `/alphysclass` - Alphys's classroom
			* `/unusedclass` - Unused classroom (former card world)
			* `/hallways` - all the lockers and whatnot. will include text for interacting with the supply closet doors
			* Locked classroom if that ever opens up
		* North street (residential)
			* Locked gate
			* Cattenheimer Residence
			* Bratty's House
			* Ghost House
			* Flower King (Asgore's shop)
		* Northeast - Lake path
		* North central street
			* ICE-E'S P"E"ZZA (Pizza place)
			* QC's diner
			* 'Sans (Grocery store)
			* Skeletons' house
			* Apartments
			* Alleyway
		* South central street
			* Police tape >.> (maybe this falls under the "interactions in the streets" thing? see below)
			* Police station
			* Hospital
			* Library
		* South
			* Church
				* Lobby
				* Hall
				* Storage room
				* Study
			* Town Hall
		* Southwest - Graveyard
		* Far south - Bunker
		* QUESTION: where to put interactions that happen in the streets... do the streets themselves need pages.
			* by "interactions in the streets" i mean things like. sans outside the grocery store. rain kid playing in the puddles. the milk sicko being like "Damn your family is messy as hell" in chapter 4
			* could put them under the building they're closest to...? But what if they're like. Not directly related to the building. I'm thinking about chapter 2 undyne "handling" the traffic jam next to the library. That wasn't involved with any nearby building
	* Dark Worlds
		* `/cardkingdom` - Chapter 1 dark world
		* `/cyberworld` - Chapter 2 dark world
		* `/tvworld` - Chapter 3 dark world
		* `/darksanctuary` - Chapter 4 dark worlds. I think for this one we can include all three sanctuaries' subpages
		* Ach how do we even subdivide these pages
* Chapters `/chapters`
	* `/chapter1`
		* ~~Vessel creation and being woken up by Toriel~~ DONE `/intro`
		* ~~School scene leading into Dark World~~ DONE `/school`
			* Ok how specific do we wanna get on this. I'm thinking I record all the character interactions for this specific scene because those are very chapter-1-this-scene-specific, you can't get them at any other point, the second you leave the classroom they're gone. BUT! The objects (e.g. board, Alphys's computer, all that) are there regardless of chapter, the wording just changes a bit, so those go to the `/locations/lightworld/alphysclass` page...?
		* Dark World begins...............
	* `/chapter2`
	* `/chapter3`
	* `/chapter4`
	* `/chapter5`
	* `/chapter6`
	* `/chapter7`
* Miscellaneous pages... `/misc`
	* `/items` - Consumables, key items, etc. Descriptions, usage text and reactions from the party members. Shop descriptions too, if we can find them? Light World equivalents also get listed, either alongside the Dark World items or in a separate section/page (with equivalents crosslinking to each other).
	* ~~`/equipment` - Weapons and armor. Descriptions, reactions from the party members, shop descriptions. LW/DW equivalents.~~ DONE up to Chapter 4
	* `/combat` - Encounters... Check descriptions, ACT descriptions, etc. This is probably gonna have a ton of subpages, I'd guess one for every potential enemy. At the very least, the big story-critical encounters (e.g. all boss fights) would need their own subpages which the `/chapters` pages could then link to.
	* ~~`/savepoints` - Youuuu guessed it. Save point text. The power of X fills you and all that.~~ DONE up to Chapter 4
	* Maybe something for general menu text...?
	* AH... TITLES... the whole, Level 1 Dark Knight stuff.
	* Oh also. Death messages. Hello again ch3 Voice
