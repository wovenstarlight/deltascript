<section class="d-section">
	<p class="note">Entering the next area, Kris and Noelle come upon a pair of narrow paths, dotted with small forcefields and switches. Some of the switches have letters on them, the first visible one bearing a letter D. On the wall beside the switch is a panel displaying a question mark with a small speaker underneath.</p>

	<p class="note">The party stops at the point where the second path begins.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Noelle" emotion="2"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Gosh, that was close, wasn't it, Kris...?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Noelle walks in front of Kris, stopping under the question mark-displaying panel and turning to Kris.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Noelle" emotion="1"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>This... Strange world... this big city...</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Noelle" emotion="9"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>It's so wild... It kind of makes my head spin.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Noelle turns to look at the panel on the wall, tilting her head.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Noelle" emotion="9"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>...?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">A pause. Noelle stops tilting her head.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Noelle" emotion="2"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Looks like another puzzle...</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Noelle turns around, looking at the second path.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Noelle" emotion="9"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>Maybe if I go... down... here?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Noelle backs up slightly, then jumps over the traffic cones separating the two paths; Kris turns to watch her. She proceeds down the path to step on the D switch and looks over to Kris's side of the path. Sure enough, the panel on the wall changes to read "<span class="yellow">D</span>" (voiced aloud from the speaker), and the forcefield in Kris's way fades out of sight.</p>

	<p class="note">Control is returned to the player, who may guide Kris over to the blank switch on their side, removing the forcefield in Noelle's way. This pattern repeats through the rest of the room, with Kris using blank switches to take down forcefields in Noelle's way, while Noelle does the same for them with lettered switches.</p>

	<p class="note">Noelle presses a switch reading "<span class="yellow">E</span>". As she and Kris walk forward, they pass behind a building in the foreground; their silhouettes can be seen "through" the building, in their associated yellow and blue respectively. Stopping at the next forcefield in her way, Noelle speaks to Kris while waiting for them to clear her way:</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Noelle</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>...when I said this city makes my head spin...</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Noelle</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>I didn't mean in a bad way... you know?</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Noelle</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>I always wanted to go someplace new, you know?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Noelle presses a switch reading "<span class="yellow">C</span>".</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Noelle</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>... And Dess... always told me she'd take me.</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Noelle</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>Somewhere like this.</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Noelle</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>Somewhere with shining lights.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Noelle presses a switch reading "<span class="yellow">E</span>".</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Noelle</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>... don't you miss exploring, Kris?</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Noelle</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>Back when the four of us were kids?</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Noelle</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>Gosh, remember that night we explored the forest behind the graveyard?</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Noelle presses a switch reading "<span class="yellow">M</span>".</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Noelle</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>Ha, I know we never found anything interesting back there...</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Noelle</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>I mostly remember... Crying because I was scared.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Noelle presses a switch reading "<span class="yellow">B</span>". When she passes behind the next foreground building, her silhouette is that of a small, much younger Noelle, her hair up in pigtails instead of loose down her back.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Noelle</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>But for some reason I feel... nostalgic thinking about it.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">The duo pass behind another foreground building; Noelle's silhouette is back to her normal teenage form.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Noelle</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>Dess wiping away my tears with Azzy's jacket...</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Noelle</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>With warm sleeves that smelled like cinnamon.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Noelle presses a switch reading "<span class="yellow">E</span>".</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Noelle</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>I guess I didn't mind being scared if it meant...</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-speaker>Noelle</d-speaker>
		<d-text asterisk>Someone would comfort me.</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Noelle presses a switch reading "<span class="yellow">R</span>" (and finishes spelling the full message, "<span class="yellow fnt-condensed">DECEMBER</span>"). Kris turns to her as she jumps over the traffic cones and walks over to them.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Noelle" emotion="6"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>(Sigh...)</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">She turns away from Kris.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Noelle" emotion="4"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>(Kris is the only one who knows how weird I am.)</d-text>
	</d-box>
	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Noelle" emotion="8"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>(It's not fair, y'know!?)</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">She turns back to Kris.</p>

	<d-box theme="dark">
		<d-sprite speaker="Noelle" emotion="4"></d-sprite>
		<d-text asterisk>(Everyone knows how weird YOU are. Fahahaha.)</d-text>
	</d-box>

	<p class="note">Control is returned to the player, who can lead the party of two onwards to a <a href="{{ '/story/chapter2/reunion' | relative_url }}">carnival area</a>.</p>
